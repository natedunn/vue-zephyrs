# Theme

> ðŸš¨ This section and its features are in early development.

Zephyrs uses a class-based, theming system to assign classes to components.

```js
export default Theme {
  ZCheckbox: {
    wrapper: "py-2 px-4 bg-gray-100 rounded inline-flex items-center hover:bg-gray-200 cursor-pointer",
    input: "mr-2 cursor-pointer",
    label: "block pointer-events-none cursor-pointer"
  },
}
```
